# PyMCQ

Python3 script generating MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) as PDFs.

## Dependencies
The script uses [reportlab](https://www.reportlab.com/) to generate the PDFs.

## Usage
The title and number of questions are customizable by editing the script (for the moment).

## Todo
* More customization (size of answer squares, number of questions per row, row per line, ...)
* Use PyQt to get the title and number of question
* Setup an environement to make standalone executables
